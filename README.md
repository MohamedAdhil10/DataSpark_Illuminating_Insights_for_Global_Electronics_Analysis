Identify purchasing patterns (average order value, frequency, preferred products).

Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior.

Sales Analysis:

Evaluate total sales trends over time.

Assess sales by product, store, and currency.

Product Analysis:

Identify popular and profitable products.

Analyze sales across product categories and subcategories.

Store Analysis:

Evaluate store performance based on sales and operational data.

Conduct geographic analysis of high-performing regions.
